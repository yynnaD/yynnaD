Hey, I'm Danny!

I am a Junior at Georgetown University pursuing a Computer Science BS. 

I’m currently learning more about low level programming and Operating Systems, as well as Machine Learning. 
I have experience in mostly C, C++, and Java, but I'm a quick learner.

I am interested in all types of programming across the stack, and I like to solve complex problems.

I’m looking to collaborate with others and work on interesting projects (Games, Apps, anything!).

Ask me about any of my projects you find in my public repositories.

More about me:
I love to code, but I also love to get outside and bike, snowboard, run, hike, you name it.
I like to play video games! (Fun Fact: I am in the top 1% of Speedrunners players)
I play club rugby at GU.
